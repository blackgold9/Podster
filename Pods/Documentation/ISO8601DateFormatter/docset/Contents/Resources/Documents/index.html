						<h1>How to use in your program</h1>

<p>Add the source files to your project.</p>

<h2>Parsing</h2>

<p>Create an ISO 8601 date formatter, then call [formatter dateFromString:myString]. The method will return either an NSDate or nil.</p>

<p>There are a total of six parser methods. The one that contains the actual parser is <a href="Classes/ISO8601DateFormatter.html#//api/name/dateComponentsFromString:timeZone:range:">[ISO8601DateFormatter dateComponentsFromString:timeZone:range:]</a>. The other five are based on this one.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;outTimeZone&rdquo; parameter, when not set to NULL, is a pointer to an NSTimeZone *variable. If the string specified a time zone, you&rsquo;ll receive the time zone object in that variable. If the string didn&rsquo;t specify a time zone, you&rsquo;ll receive nil.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;outRange&rdquo; parameter, when not set to NULL, is a pointer to NSRange storage. You will receive the range of the parsed substring in that storage.</p>

<h2>Unparsing</h2>

<p>Create an ISO 8601 date formatter, then call [formatter stringFromDate:myDate]. The method will return a string.</p>

<p>The formatter has several properties that control its behavior:</p>

<ul>
<li>You can set the format of the resulting strings. By default, the formatter will generate calendar-date strings; your other options are week dates and ordinal dates.</li>
<li>You can set a default time zone; by default, it will use [NSTimeZone defaultTimeZone].</li>
<li>You can enable a strict mode, wherein the formatter enforces sanity checks on the string. By default, the parser will afford you quite a bit of leeway.</li>
<li>You can set whether to include the time in the string, and if so, what hour-minute separator to use (default &lsquo;:&rsquo;).</li>
</ul>


<h1>How to test that this code works</h1>

<p>&lsquo;make test&rsquo; will perform all tests. If you want to perform only <em>some</em> tests:</p>

<h2>Parsing</h2>

<p>Type &lsquo;make parser-test&rsquo;. make will build the test program (testparser), then invoke testparser.sh.py to generate testparser.sh. Then make will invoke testparser.sh, which will invoke the test program with various dates.</p>

<p>If you don&rsquo;t want to use my tests, &lsquo;make testparser&rsquo; will create the test program without running it. You can then invoke testparser yourself with any date you want to. If it doesn&rsquo;t give you the result you expected, contact me, making sure to provide me with both the input and the output.</p>

<h2>Unparsing</h2>

<p>Type &lsquo;make unparser-test&rsquo;. make will build the test programs, then invoke testunparser.sh. This shell script invokes each test program for -01-01 of every year from 1991 to 2010, writing the output to a file, and then runs diff -qs between that file (testunparser.out) and a file (testunparser-expected.out) containing known correct output. diff should report that the files are identical.</p>

<p>Three test programs are included: unparse-date, unparse-weekdate, and unparse-ordinal date. If you don&rsquo;t want to use my tests, you can make these test programs separately. Each takes a date specified by ISO 8601 (parsed with my own ISO 8601 parser), and outputs a string that should represent the same date.</p>

<h1>Notes</h1>

<h2>Version history</h2>

<p>This version is 0.6. Changes from 0.5:
* When not set to strict parsing, allow a space before the time-zone specification, for greater compatibility with NSDate output (<code>description</code>) and input (<code>dateWithString:</code>). 27603efc8a77
* Bug fix: We no longer try to format the formatter. 83415de9f527
* Bug fix: Hours are now zero-padded correctly (<a href="https://bitbucket.org/boredzo/iso-8601-parser-unparser/issue/4/time-zones-are-emitted-without-leading">#4</a>). a5608e189ebe af0c6b397428
* Fixed many various compiler warnings. Some fixes contributed by Sparks. 8be3d6f7c6f2 78ae31de2170 68dc351e9fdb e7ea87db8621 873f499ae6db
* Now 75 times faster. 6a023812bd2b 05dc35d6b505 3b2225e0ce8c d59720ad015a 10f526956963 297b8dae4095 796be11aa596 cadf0f0c8199 61d2959c6921
* iOS users can now tell the ISO 8601 date formatter class to drop its caches (which you should do when you receive a memory warning). 2bb1725914b1
* Added a couple of command-line options to the calendar-format-unparser test tool. c644aadb2b14
* The parser test tool now displays parsed dates in GMT rather than the local time zone. 788c1455ecb1
* Added a test tool to test unparsing with the time included. a89a9a8b3d61
* You can now “make analysis” to run the Clang Static Analyzer on the date formatter. b3dd33841f42
* The test tools are now built using Clang. 0723d3aa6596</p>

<p>Changes in 0.5 from 0.4:
* Rewrote as an NSFormatter subclass using NSCalendar.
  * Making it a formatter makes it much easier to use with Bindings.
  * Using NSCalendar means we&rsquo;re no longer using NSCalendarDate, which Apple has said they will deprecate at some point.
* Fixed a bug in week date generation: One subtraction could give a negative result, which was a problem because my implementation of the algorithm used unsigned integers. I&rsquo;ve changed it to use signed integers, so the result truly is negative now. I also added a test case for this.</p>

<p>Changes in 0.4 from 0.3:
* Added the ability to use a time separator other than &lsquo;:&rsquo;.</p>

<p>Changes in 0.3 from 0.2:
* Colin Barrett noticed that I used %m instead of %M when creating the time strings. Oops.
* Colin also noticed that I had the ?: in -ISO8601DateStringWithTime: the wrong way around. Oops again.</p>

<p>Changes in 0.2 from 0.1:
* The unparser is new. The  has been munged to allow both components together,
* The parser has not changed.</p>

<h2>Parsing</h2>

<p>Whitespace before a date, and anything after a date, is ignored. Thus, &ldquo;    T23 and all&rsquo;s well&rdquo; is a valid date for the purpose of this method. (Yes, T23 is a valid ISO 8601 date. It means 23:00:00, or 11 PM.)</p>

<p>All of the frills of ISO 8601 are supported, except for extended dates (years longer than 4 digits). Specifically, you can use week-based dates (2006-W2 for the second week of 2006), ordinal dates (2006-365 for December 31), decimal minutes (11:30.5 == 11:30:30), and decimal seconds (11:30:10.5). All methods of specifying a time zone are supported.</p>

<p>ISO 8601 leaves quite a bit up to the parties exchanging dates. I hope I&rsquo;ve chosen reasonable defaults. For example (note that I&rsquo;m writing this on 2006-02-24):</p>

<p>• If the month or month and date are missing, 1 is assumed. &ldquo;2006&rdquo; == &ldquo;2006-01-01&rdquo;.
• If the year or year and month are missing, the current ones are assumed. &ldquo;&mdash;02-01&rdquo; == &ldquo;2006-02-01&rdquo;. &ldquo;&mdash;-28&rdquo; == &ldquo;2006-02-28&rdquo;.
• In the case of week-based dates, with  the day missing, this implementation returns the first day of that week: 2006-W1 is 2006-01-01, 2006-W2 is 2006-01-08, etc.
• For any date without a time, midnight on that date is used.
• ISO 8601 permits the choice of either T0 or T24 for midnight. This implementation uses T0. T24 will get you T0 on the following day.
• If no time-zone is specified, local time (as returned by [NSTimeZone localTimeZone]) is used.</p>

<p>When a date is parsed that has a year but no century, this implementation adds the current century.</p>

<p>The implementation is tolerant of out-of-range numbers. For example, &ldquo;2005-13-40T24:62:89&rdquo; == 1:02 AM on 2006-02-10. Notice that the month (13 > 12), date (40 > 31), hour (24 > 23), minute (62 > 59), and second (89 > 59) are all out-of-range.</p>

<p>As mentioned above, there is a &ldquo;strict&rdquo; mode that enforces sanity checks. In particular, the date must be the entire contents of the string, and numbers are range-checked. If you have any suggestions on how to make this mode more strict, contact me.</p>

<h2>Unparsing</h2>

<p>I use Rick McCarty&rsquo;s algorithm for converting calendar dates to week dates (<a href="http://personal.ecu.edu/mccartyr/ISOwdAlg.txt">http://personal.ecu.edu/mccartyr/ISOwdAlg.txt),</a>,) slightly tweaked.</p>

<h1>Bugs</h1>

<h2>Parsing</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>This method won&rsquo;t extract a date from just anywhere in a string, only immediately after the start of the string (or any leading whitespace). There are two solutions: either require you to invoke the parser on a string that is only an ISO 8601 date, with nothing before or after (bad for parsing purposes), or make the parser able to find an ISO 8601 date as a substring. I won&rsquo;t do the first one, and barring a patch, I probably won&rsquo;t do the second one either.</p></li>
<li><p>Date ranges (also specified by ISO 8601) are not supported; this method will only return one date. To handle ranges would require at least one more method.</p></li>
<li><p>There is no method to analyze a date string and tell you what was found in it (year, month, week, day, ordinal day, etc.). Feel free to submit a patch.</p></li>
</ul>
